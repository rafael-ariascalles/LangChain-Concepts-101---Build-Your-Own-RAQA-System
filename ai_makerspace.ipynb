    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",

      "The best way to write a loop depends on the specific situation and the programming language you are using. However, I can provide some general tips for writing loops efficiently and effectively:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Choose the appropriate type of loop: Depending on the nature of your task, you can use different types of loops such as \"for\" loop, \"while\" loop, or \"do-while\" loop. Make sure to select the loop type that best fits your problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Define your loop condition: Determine the condition under which the loop should continue executing. This could be based on a specific value, a certain range, or a boolean expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Initialize loop variables correctly: If you are using variables within your loop, ensure that they are initialized properly before the loop begins, especially if you're using a \"while\" loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Update loop variables: Inside the loop, update the loop variables according to the desired logic. This could involve incrementing or decrementing a counter, modifying a specific variable, or accessing elements in an iterable.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Break or continue when necessary: Use \"break\" statements to exit the loop prematurely if a certain condition is met. Utilize \"continue\" statements to skip the remaining code within the loop for specific iterations.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Avoid infinite loops: Ensure that your loop has a proper exit condition to avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop. This could be as simple as checking the value of a variable or incorporating a counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Keep your code concise and readable: Write clear and understandable loop logic. Use descriptive variable names and include comments where necessary to enhance code readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the best way to write a loop can vary depending on the specific programming language and the problem you are trying to solve. It's always a good practice to consult the official documentation or style guidelines for the language you are working with.\n"
